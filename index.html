					I am a dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer from Brazil with over two years of experience in B2B applications. Proficient in PHP, I can leverage the resources of its frameworks, like Symfony and Laravel, to deliver robust solutions with good knowledge of Vanilla Javascript and its libraries React and Vue. A fluent Git user, I also have hands-on experience working with containerized services like Docker, relational databases such as Postgres and MySQL, Python, GNU/Linux and developing APIs. My technical toolkit also includes familiarity with Redis, GraphQL, and RabbitMQ. Known for my problem-solving skills, excellent interpersonal relationship, carefulness for documenting and writing easily readable code, a.k.a. clean code. I like to use Test Driven Development as much as possible. I am an enthusiast of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects.
