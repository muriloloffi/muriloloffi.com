					I am a dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer from Brazil with over two years of experience in B2B applications. Proficient in PHP, its frameworks, Symfony and Laravel, good knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and its libraries React and Vue. I enjoy taking part in tasks from end to end, although I feel more at home with the behind-the-scenes details - some rather call this "back-end". A fluent Git user, I also have hands-on experience working with containerized services using Docker, relational databases such as Postgres and MySQL, GNU/Linux and developing APIs. My technical toolkit also includes familiarity with Python, Redis, GraphQL and RabbitMQ. Known for my problem-solving skills, excellent interpersonal relationship, carefulness for documenting and writing easily readable code, a.k.a. clean code, I like to use Test Driven Development (TDD) as much as possible. Also, I am an enthusiast of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects.
